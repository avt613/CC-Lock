CC-Lock

This program is made to close a preset application between certain set times. The current code is set to close Candy Crush between 13:40 and 18:00.
I made it for someone who found that when he was on the computer, instead of doing work, he would end up just playing games.

There are main files of code "CClock.au3", "CCconfig.au3" and "CCsystray.au3".
"CCconfig.au3" contains all of the configurations.
"CClock.au3" is the program which monitors for when the preset application is opened and kills the process of open.
"CCsystray.au3" is the system tray icon and has the option of closing CClock after typing in the correct password. It also reopens CClock if closed.
The program is coded in autoit so you may need to download the code executor and compiler from the official website to run the code or to convert it to an exe file. https://www.autoitscript.com/site/autoit/downloads/
